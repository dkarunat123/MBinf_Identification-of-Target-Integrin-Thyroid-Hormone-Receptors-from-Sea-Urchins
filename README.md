## Abstract

Integrin αVβ3 is a well-characterized non-canonical receptor for thyroid hormones (TH) in vertebrates, yet echinoderms lack a direct β3 ortholog. I hypothesized that conserved or structurally analogous sea urchin integrins could form comparable TH-binding pockets with ligand selectivity patterns resembling αVβ3. Six Strongylocentrotus purpuratus heterodimers (αVβG, αVβ1-A, αVβC, αPβG, αPβ1-A, αPβC) were modeled using AlphaFold-Multimer, with human αVβ3 serving as a reference. Model confidence was evaluated via pLDDT, pTM, ipTM, and RMSD to the αVβ3 crystal structure (PDB 1L5G). High-confidence extracellular domain predictions enabled in-silico docking in HADDOCK against cyclic RGD and seven TH metabolites (rT3, T4, T3, TRIAC, TETRAC, sT3, sT4), followed by binding free energy (ΔG) and dissociation constant (KD) estimation in PRODIGY. Among sea urchin integrins, αPβ1-A most closely matched αVβ3 binding behavior, showing sub-micromolar affinity for all ligands and low-nanomolar affinity for sT3 and sT4. αPβG and αVβ1-A also displayed strong binding profiles, whereas βC-containing dimers showed greater structural divergence and weaker, more variable affinities. These findings identify αPβ1-A as the strongest candidate for a functional analog of αVβ3 in S. purpuratus, consistent with prior evidence that THs bind sea urchin membranes and regulate gene expression. This study supports the hypothesis that integrin-mediated, non-canonical TH signaling is an evolutionarily conserved feature and provides a computational framework for predicting functional analogs in species lacking direct orthologs.
